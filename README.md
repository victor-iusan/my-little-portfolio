### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

  My name is Victor Iusan and I am currently looking for oportunities in the software testing / quality assurance industry.
  I have a great interest and passion for the QA field, strong analytical and research skills, good attention to detail and work ethic. A huge inspiration for me was the book "How to
become a Software QA Tester" by Roman Savenkov and all James Bach`s speeches.
  I graduated a Manual Tester Course provided by Ejobs Group inside the "Coderslab" project with a grade of 9,55 at the final exam. During the 120 hours of the course, I acquired theoretical knowledge of testing types, testing principles, SDLC, Agile methodology, test analysis and design etc and also practical knowledge of working with test cases and bug reporting and the basis of programs like Jira, TestLink, Postman, SQL.
  I then obtained the ISTQB Certified Tester Foundation Level Certification, an international qualification of software testing skills and knowledge. I passed the exam with 87.5% (35 correct answers out of 40).
  In order to get a taste of the experience of actual software testing corporate working environment and to gain further practical experience in the QA field, I am currently working on a manual testing project for a Banking application - Guru99 Bank. I just started the 13-day challenge and I will post here my test work products. Here is a glimpse of my work:
