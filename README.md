### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

  My name is Victor Iusan and I am currently making my first steps in the software testing world.
  I graduated a Manual Tester Course and I passed the ISTQB Certified Tester Foundation Level Certification.
  In order to get a taste of the experience of actual software testing corporate working environment and to gain further practical experience in the QA field, I am currently working on a manual testing project for a Banking application - Guru99 Bank. I just started the 13-day challenge and I will post here my test work products. Here is a glimpse of my work:
