### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

  <br> My name is Victor Iusan and I am currently making my first steps in the software testing world. <br />
  I recently graduated a Manual Tester Course and I obtained the ISTQB Certified Tester Foundation Level Certification. <br />
  At the final exam of the course, we had to make 3 test cases in TestLink and 3 bug reports in Jira regarding this website: https://courses-presta-prod.visuality.pl/index.php. <br />
  Check my work below (in romanian): [test cases+bug reports My Store.pdf](https://github.com/victor-iusan/victor-iusan/files/9792182/test.cases%2Bbug.reports.My.Store.pdf).
