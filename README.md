### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

  <br> My name is Victor Iusan and I am currently making my first steps in the software testing world. I recently graduated a Manual Tester Course and I obtained the ISTQB Certified Tester Foundation Level Certification. <br />
   <br> At the final exam of the course, we had to make 3 test cases in TestLink and 3 bug reports in Jira regarding this website: https://courses-presta-prod.visuality.pl/index.php. Check my work below (in romanian): [test cases+bug reports My Store.pdf](https://github.com/victor-iusan/victor-iusan/files/9792182/test.cases%2Bbug.reports.My.Store.pdf). <br />
 <br> Subsequently, I tested and created bug reports for a demo website (https://www.wavemyth.com/qa-challenge/). Here`s the website design ![design](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/114483605/198003764-3c05ce69-d27f-4316-8b61-b3ad360de057.jpg) and bug reports: https://github.com/victor-iusan/BerYoga/issues <br />
