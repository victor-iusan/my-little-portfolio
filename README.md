### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

  <br> My name is Victor Iusan and I am currently making my first steps in the software testing world. I recently graduated a Manual Tester Course and I obtained the ISTQB Certified Tester Foundation Level Certification. <br />
   <br> At the final exam of the course, we had to make 3 test cases in TestLink and 3 bug reports in Jira regarding this website: https://courses-presta-prod.visuality.pl/index.php. Check my work below (in romanian): [test cases+bug reports My Store.pdf](https://github.com/victor-iusan/victor-iusan/files/9792182/test.cases%2Bbug.reports.My.Store.pdf). <br />
  <br> In order to get a taste of the experience of actual software testing corporate working environment and to gain further practical experience in the QA field, I am currently working on a manual testing project from https://www.guru99.com/live-testing-project.html for a Banking application - Guru99 Bank. I just started the 13-day challenge and I will post here my test work products. Here is a glimpse of my work: [My test cases - Guru99 bank - New Customer.pdf](https://github.com/victor-iusan/victor-iusan/files/9675060/My.test.cases.-.Guru99.bank.-.New.Customer.pdf) <br />
