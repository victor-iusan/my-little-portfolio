### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

  <br> My name is Victor Iusan and here is my QA portfolio. <br />
  <br> I have a great interest and passion for the QA field, strong analytical and research skills, good attention to detail and work ethic. A huge inspiration for me was the book "How to become a Software QA Tester" by Roman Savenkov and all James Bach`s speeches. <br />
<br> I graduated a Manual Tester Course provided by Ejobs Group inside the "Coderslab" project with a grade of 9,55 at the final exam. During the 120 hours of the course, I acquired theoretical knowledge of testing types, testing principles, SDLC, Agile methodology, test analysis and design etc and also practical knowledge of working with test cases and bug reporting and the basis of programs like Jira, TestLink, Postman, SQL.  At the final exam of the course, we had to make 3 test cases in TestLink and 3 bug reports in Jira regarding this website: https://courses-presta-prod.visuality.pl/index.php. Check my work below (in romanian): [test cases+bug reports My Store.pdf](https://github.com/victor-iusan/victor-iusan/files/9792182/test.cases%2Bbug.reports.My.Store.pdf). <br />
I then obtained the ISTQB Certified Tester Foundation Level Certification, an international qualification of software testing skills and knowledge. I passed the exam with 87.5% (35 correct answers out of 40). <br />
   <br> Subsequently, I tested a demo website (https://www.wavemyth.com/qa-challenge/) and created some bug reports (https://github.com/victor-iusan/BerYoga/issues). <br />
